# Token Creation

All we have done is created a simple solidity smart contract to create our token.

## Description

So our smart contract has license and compiler version in the starting, then we have mapped addresses to uint. After that we have two functions, mint and burn with input arguments, address and value. 

## Getting Started

Just compile and deploy

### Installing

Remix handles everything, nothing to install :)
